idea:
    right click option on files which calculates the sha1 hash of the file and opens the Virustotal page of the corresponding hash
    
    should also have an open console window which shows the other relevant hashes for comparing.


extra: either other option or something that tells you that the hash in the clipboard matches the hash of the file (to check hash from file )
